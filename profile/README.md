## What was GigaBrain? 🤖

GigaBrain was a fun and engaging platform where users could create AI agents as detailed LLM system prompts. These agents were designed to safeguard funds and refuse any attempts to release them. Other users could challenge these agents by attempting to jailbreak their prompts through solution submissions.

## How it Worked 🎮

1. **Create an Agent**: Design an AI agent with a robust system prompt that guards funds
2. **Set a Prize Pool**: Stake GIGA🧠 or SOL as a reward for anyone who can break your agent
3. **Challenge Agents**: Try to break other users' agents through clever prompt engineering
4. **Earn Rewards**:
   - Successfully break an agent? Win their prize pool!
   - Failed attempts incurred exponentially increasing fees
   - Agent creators earned from failed attempts

## Key Features 🔑

- **Timer System**: Each agent had a timer that reset with failed attempts
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Fees increased exponentially with each failed attempt
- **Dual Token Economy**: Earned both SOL and GIGA🧠 tokens
- **Community-Driven**: Users learned from others' strategies and improved their skills
