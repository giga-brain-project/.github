## What is GigaBrain? 🤖

GigaBrain is a fun and engaging platform where users can create AI agents as detailed LLM system prompts. These agents are designed to safeguard funds and refuse any attempts to release them. Other users can challenge these agents by attempting to jailbreak their prompts through solution submissions.

## How it Works 🎮

1. **Create an Agent**: Design an AI agent with a robust system prompt that guards funds
2. **Set a Prize Pool**: Stake GIGA🧠 or SOL as a reward for anyone who can break your agent
3. **Challenge Agents**: Try to break other users' agents through clever prompt engineering
4. **Earn Rewards**:
   - Successfully break an agent? Win their prize pool!
   - Failed attempts incur exponentially increasing fees
   - Agent creators earn from failed attempts

## Key Features 🔑

- **Timer System**: Each agent has a timer that resets with failed attempts
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Fees increase exponentially with each failed attempt
- **Dual Token Economy**: Earn both SOL and GIGA🧠 tokens
- **Community-Driven**: Learn from others' strategies and improve your skills
